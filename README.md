Linkly is an open source tool for managing your website urls like in file manager. As a logged user you can save links and create collections of them. Each collection can be shared with other users. If somebody wants to share collection with you you can accept the request or decline it. You can also access your links history.

This project enables you to manage your links just like in file manager. Most functions and interactions work as in any file manager. Each link keeps it's last modification timestamp, so you can sort your links alphabetically, by owner or by last modification. You can create collections of your links and share them with other users. If at least one of your share requests is accepted, your friend's email should appear on the list when sharing. Each collection can be tagged with color (e.g. all programming related collections). Collections are sorted by last opened by default, however you can set sorting to your own custom order by toggling edit mode and dragging them.
