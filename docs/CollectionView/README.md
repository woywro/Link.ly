  <li><b>Current location</b><br/>Click on <ins>collections</ins> to go back to homescreen.</li>
  <li><b>Tag switcher</b><br/>Use it to switch tags. E.g. if you have many programming related links, instead of putting all of them in <ins>Programming</ins> collection you can split them to smaller collections and tag with one color.</li>
     <li><b>Sharing collection</b><br/>Use it to share collection. If your friend has account you can share collections. If at least one of your share requests is accepted, you'll see your friend's email on dropdown to make it easier to share next collection. Once your share request is accepted you'll see green dot next to your friend's email, otherwise it'll be red. To stop sharing collection simply click on your friend's email.</li>
